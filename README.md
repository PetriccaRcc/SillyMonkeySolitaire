# Silly Monkey Solitaire

Silly Monkey Solitaire is my first project as programmer, back in 2014:
a Game With A Purpose (GWAP) for the Semantic network of http://babelnet.org, which is founded by the ERC.

It handles asynchronous communications with the babelnet server.

The game is entirely done from scratch with LibGDX in Java, and it runs on the folowing platforms:

- Android 4.0+
- iOS 5+
- Web Browser Application (Gradle, GWT)
- Windows Desktop
- MacOSX

It's entirely done by me: Riccardo Petricca.

# Silly Monkey Solitaire

Silly Monkey Solitaire is one of my first projects as multiple platform developer, back in 2014:

it's basically a masked solitaire, which is in reality a Game With A Purpose (GWAP), done for the Semantic network of http://babelnet.org, which is founded by the European Research Council.

It handles asynchronous communications with the babelnet server.

The game is entirely done from scratch with LibGDX in Java, and it runs on the folowing platforms:

- Android 4.0+
- iOS 5+
- Web Browser Application (Gradle, GWT)
- Windows Desktop
- MacOSX

It's entirely done by me: Riccardo Petricca.

Note: 
This project has been discontinued by the end of 2016 due to the closed babelnet.org servers for the specific GWAP use.

# Silly Monkey Solitaire

Silly Monkey Solitaire is an outstanding project which I've done entirely alone, and on platform specific native languages, as multiple platform developer:

It is a solitair, but that's a masked solitaire, which is in reality a Game With A Purpose (GWAP), in which asyncronous calls are done for the Semantic network of http://babelnet.org, which is founded by the European Research Council.

The project is entirely done from scratch with LibGDX in Java, and it runs on the folowing platforms:

- Android 4.0+
- iOS 5+
- Web Browser Application (Gradle, GWT)
- Windows Desktop
- MacOSX

Note: 
This project has been discontinued by the end of 2016 due to the closed babelnet.org servers for the specific GWAP use.
